			<li>Magic City ,ID,</li>
			<li>Bountiful, UT, </li>
			<li>Last Chance , CO,</li>

	<h2>July 14,2012</h2>
	<p>
		I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
		road today : <blockquote>Passing cars, <br>When you can't see,<br> May get
		you,<br> A glimpse,<br> Of eternity. <br>
		</blockquote>
		I definitely won't be passing
		any cars.

		My first  day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything
		packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,I was't able to bring
		a whole lot with me:&#208;
		<ol>
			<li>Charge Segway </li>
			<li>Pack for trip</li>
			<ul>
				<li>cell phone</li>
				<li>iPod</li>
				<li>digital</li>
				<li>camera</li>
				<li>and a protein bar</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Call mon</li>
		</ol>
